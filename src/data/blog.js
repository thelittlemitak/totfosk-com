  title: "The origin of the name Tot Fosk",
  body: "The name Tot Fosk comes from 'tot fosc', which in Catalan means 'all dark'. The reason I chose this name was not because my music could eventually be tagged as 'dark techno' or something like that, but because my thoughts on the relationship between images and music. I just don't like the modus operandi of the music industry (a mirror of people's behaviour). Instagram numbers is the currency of the DJ/electronic music industry, so what favours Instagram's algorithm favours 'the artist' (pretty faces, short videos, gossip, etc.). So, what problem do I have with this? The impact on new generations. The sense of artist for most kids will be lost forever when they realize that taking a pic will give them more benefits than doing something more creative like producing a track. I still remember the day that someone showed me the Afterlife video (yeah that one) with the audio muted. A kid said that he liked techno and his way of showing me his reference was passing me the phone with that video and no sound. The perfect analogy. A similar thing happens if I tell someone that I am a drummer. The response is always the same: 'do you know XYZ?' (a Tik Tok drummer that does 15 seconds videos playing at ligh speed and none-musical). Kids will eventually know only about what they see, not what they hear. Imagine a world without pictures. Who would be the artists if everyone had to hear instead of watching? The only way to connect with people would be through the emotions music sends. As someone once said: 'music was better when ugly people were allowed to sing'.",

  title: "Why this website?",
  body: "Do I really need a website? That's a good question. But guess what... I am a web developer too! And I made this website while searching for a job so I thought it was a good idea to do something 'real' that had a purpose instead of another weather App. This said, it is true that, most of it, has been put there just to practice some functionalities but for instance, the influences section, I really like it and wanted to do something like this for a long time (if you have been following me, this albums were from the same posts I had on Instagram long ago). There I can have a list of my favorite music and also share it with others. The blog and the forms you will see that they don't work (or are lost after updating). This is because there's no backend yet.",
