  title: "The origin of the name Tot Fosk",
  body: "The name Tot Fosk comes from 'tot fosc', which in Catalan means 'all dark'. The reason I chose this name was not because my music could eventually be tagged as dark, but because my thoughts on the relationship between images and music. Instagram numbers are currently the currency of the DJ/electronic music industry, and what favours Instagram's algorithm favours the new artists (pretty faces, short videos, gossip, booths with flames, etc.). Sometimes I wonder if, in the future, the sense of artistry for new generations will be lost forever when they realize that taking a pic will give them more benefits than doing something more creative like producing a track. And that's scary. Kids will eventually know only about what they see, not what they hear. When I think about Tot Fosk, I imagine a world without pictures, where musical communication is blind. The only way to connect with people would be through the emotions music transfers. As someone once said: 'music was better when ugly people were allowed to make it'.",

  title: "Why this website?",
  body: "Do I really need a website? That's a good question. But guess what... I am a web developer too! And I made this website while searching for a job, so I thought it was a good idea to do something 'real' that had a purpose, instead of another weather App (the typical YT project template). This said, it is true that, most of it, has been put there just to practice some functionalities but for instance, the influences section, I really like it and wanted to do something like this for a long time (if you have been following me, these albums were from the same posts I had on Instagram long ago). There I can have a list of my favorite music and also share it with others. The blog and the forms you will see that they don't work (or are lost after updating). This is because what I am currently doing is mostly frontend development, which is the part of the website that your browser handles. Backend is the logic at the server, but that is still on the learning process!",

// I still remember the day that someone showed me the Afterlife video (yeah that one) with the audio muted. A kid said that he liked techno and his way of showing me his reference was passing me the phone with that video and no sound. The perfect analogy. A similar thing happens if I tell someone that I am a drummer. The response is always the same: 'do you know XYZ?' (a Tik Tok drummer that does 15 seconds videos playing at light speed in a none-musical manner).
