I was so young that I couldn't even tell that what I was hearing was Mike's guitar solo. For me it was just perfection. Funnywise, next time I heard the words `Tubular Bells` it was 15 years later, when I was studying progressive Rock at Uni. The name came out and I went home to find this track again. I almost freak out when I found it.",
